To gain the speed benefits of indexing at retrieval time, 
we have to build the index in advance. The major steps 
in this are: Collect the documents to be indexed, 
tokenize the text, turning each document into a 
list of tokens, do linguistic preprocessing, 
producing a list of normalized tokens, 
which are the indexing term.
